The dataset is split into the following ways:
- **val_images**: Validation images
- **val_annotations.json**: COCO format annotations for validation set. It contains image names and IDs, but only two annotations are provided, as a sanity check. The evaluation script expects this exact format. Make sure to not change image names and IDs and to write the predictions in the same format.
